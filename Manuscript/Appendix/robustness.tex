In the original results, we defined the unit of observation---a market---as a therapeutic class--year. In Panel (a), the unit of observation is a therapeutic class--two year period i.e., 1996-1997 is period 1, 1998-1999 is period 2, and so on. In Panel (b), the unit of observation is a therapeutic class--five year period i.e., 1996-2000 is period 1, 2001-2005 is period 2, and so on. Robust standard errors clustered at the ATC-1 level are shown in parentheses. Significance codes: * p<.1, ** p<.05, *** p<.01

    \caption*{\scriptsize\emph{Notes:} 
    Panel (a) replicates the baseline results from Table \ref{tab:baseline-regressions-all-props}, where the variable Target Diversity has been replaced with HHI. A higher HHI value indicates that experiments are concentrated in a handful of approaches, and thus the market is less diverse. Panel (b) replicates the baseline results from Table \ref{tab:baseline-regressions-all-props} where we define success as a drug development project ultimately leading to a drug product launch. Robust standard errors clustered at the ATC-1 level are shown in parentheses. Significance codes: * p<.1, ** p<.05, *** p<.01
